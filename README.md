# 1011 RJ22 CAB I/F & Terminators
This board is a development of the MERG CBUS RJ22 connector. It is the same size and the RJ22 sockets are positioned on the board exactly as the ones on the MERG board. It may similarly be sawn in half so that each half may be installed at opposite ends of the CAN bus. The differences lie firstly in the fact that there are four CAN bus interfaces rather than two which are all similarly orientated and secondly in the fact that the two 120 Ohm resistors may be routinely installed and individually connected to the CAN bus by applying a solder bridge to a jumper imprinted in the copper on the component side.
